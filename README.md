# vibe

A CLI tool that assists you in vibe coding, essentially a scripted workflow system guiding your agent.

## Overview

Vibe is an intelligent workflow orchestrator that analyzes your natural language prompts and automatically executes the appropriate development workflows. It's designed to make "vibe coding" - that flow state of rapid, intuitive development - more structured and productive.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Prompt Analysis**: Uses pattern matching to understand what you want to accomplish
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Automatically executes workflows in the optimal order
- **Project Type Detection**: Supports multiple project types (Python, Vue/TypeScript, etc.)
- **Cross-Platform Compatible**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-aware guidance
- **Configurable**: Customize workflows and commands for your project needs
- **Rich Output**: Beautiful, colored terminal output with progress indicators
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom workflows and project types
- **Automated Releases**: Full CI/CD pipeline with semantic versioning and marketplace publishing

## Installation

```bash
# Install with npm (recommended)
npm install -g vibe-workflow

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/user/vibe
cd vibe
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize vibe in your project
vibe init

# Run a workflow based on natural language
vibe "analyze the codebase structure"
vibe "implement user authentication"
vibe "run all tests and check quality"
vibe "create a pull request"
```

## Workflow YAML Quality Tools

Validate and normalize the built-in YAML workflows or your custom ones:

```bash
# Validate all workflow YAML files (schema, encoding, unknown keys)
vibe workflows validate

# Preview normalization changes (key order, legacy migrations)
vibe workflows format

# Apply normalization changes in-place
vibe workflows format --write
```

## Project Linting

Comprehensive project quality analysis with naming conventions, language professionalism, and emoji detection:

```bash
# Lint entire project for quality issues
vibe lint project

# Filter by severity or issue type
vibe lint project --severity=warning --type=emoji_usage

# Different output formats
vibe lint project --format=summary
vibe lint project --format=json

# Lint specific text content
vibe lint text "This is awesome! ðŸ˜€"

# Context-specific text analysis
vibe lint text "Long workflow step message..." --context=step_message
```

**Features:**

- **Naming Conventions**: File and directory naming consistency
- **Language Quality**: Professional language detection and emoji analysis
- **Smart Filtering**: Gitignore integration and context-aware exclusions
- **High Performance**: Pre-filtering architecture for large codebases
- **[Full Documentation](docs/project-linting.md)**: Comprehensive linting guide

## Workflow Types

- **Analysis**: Codebase exploration, pattern identification, research
- **Implementation**: Feature development, bug fixes, code changes
- **Testing**: Test execution, validation, quality verification
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates, guides, explanations
- **Quality**: Code quality, linting, formatting, compliance
- **Git**: Git operations, commits, PRs, repository management
- **MCP**: MCP tools integration and AI-enhanced workflows
- **Session**: Session management, completion, cleanup

## AI Agent Integration

**[GitHub Configuration](.github/README.md)**: AI agent collaboration setup

This project uses Vibe to develop itself (dogfooding). AI agents working on Vibe should:

- **Follow [copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md)**: Comprehensive development guidelines
- **Use [vibe-agent.chatmode.md](.github/chatmodes/vibe-agent.chatmode.md)**: VSCode Copilot chat mode
- **Query Vibe workflows first**: Always use `npx vibe "what should I do for [task]?"` before manual operations
- **Demonstrate capabilities**: Show Vibe's natural language interface by using it
- **Create new workflows**: Document successful patterns as YAML workflows

## Concise-by-default (TPS-aware)

Vibe is optimized to minimize tokens-per-second and overall token footprint:

- Always concise guidance: short summaries, delta updates, â‰¤6 bullets
- Quiet flags by default (e.g., `pytest -q --maxfail=1`, `mypy --hide-error-context --no-error-summary`)
- Sample large listings (e.g., `head`) and avoid dumping long outputs
- Prefer batched operations over many small calls; backoff + jitter on 429s
- Guidance steps are messages (not commands) and include inline command examples when needed

Downstream projects can keep their workflows token-thrifty by mirroring these patterns.

## Configuration

Create a `.vibe.yaml` file in your project root to customize workflows:

```yaml
project_type: 'typescript' # or "auto" for detection
workflows:
  testing:
    commands:
      - 'npm test'
      - 'npm run lint'
  quality:
    commands:
      - 'npm run type-check'
      - 'npm run format'
```
