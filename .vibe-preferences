# Vibe Project Preferences
# This file contains functional preferences for AI agents working on this project

# File creation policy: NO summary/report/documentation-only files
# Everything must serve a functional purpose:
# - Code that executes
# - Configuration that's used
# - Scripts that run
# - Tests that validate
# - Essential READMEs for setup/usage only

# Anti-patterns to avoid:
# - SUMMARY.md files
# - REPORT.md files  
# - OVERVIEW.md files
# - Implementation documentation that just describes what was done
# - Status reports
# - Meeting notes
# - Change logs that aren't functional

# Exception: READMEs are OK if they provide essential setup/usage instructions
