name: Workflow Completion Validation Checklist
description: Ensures all workflow sessions are properly completed or broken out before
  ending development sessions.
triggers:
  - workflow completion validation
  - session workflow check
  - validate workflow status
  - check incomplete workflows
items:
  - "All active workflow sessions identified: Used 'list_workflow_sessions' to check
    for active sessions."
  - "Session health monitored: Used 'monitor_sessions' to check for alerts about dormant
    or forgotten workflows."
  - 'Alerts addressed: Any session alerts (dormant, stale, forgotten completion) have
    been resolved.'
  - "Workflows advanced or completed: Active workflows either advanced with 'advance_workflow'
    or completed with 'break_workflow'."
  - "Stale sessions cleaned: Used 'cleanup_stale_sessions' to remove old inactive
    sessions."
  - "No orphaned sessions: Final check with 'list_workflow_sessions' shows no unintended
    active sessions."
  - 'Workflow lifecycle respected: All workflow state transitions properly managed (start
    → advance/break → complete).'
  - "Session monitoring clean: 'monitor_sessions' shows no remaining alerts or issues."
