description: Checklist to prevent excessive refactoring that degrades code quality.
name: over-refactoring-prevention
project_types: []
steps:
  - 'Ensure: Extracted functions perform meaningful operations, not trivial wrappers'
  - 'Ensure: Function names clearly indicate purpose without needing implementation
    details'
  - 'Ensure: No eta reduction functions that simply call another function'
  - 'Ensure: Related logic remains cohesive rather than scattered across multiple files'
  - 'One-line operations: not extracted into separate functions'
  - 'Ensure: Function signatures provide clear abstraction boundaries'
  - 'Ensure: Code readability improved rather than decreased after extraction'
  - Ensure Functions can be understood independently without excessive context switching
  - 'Complexity reduction: measurable and significant'
  - 'Ensure: Refactoring addresses genuine complexity issues, not cosmetic preferences'
triggers:
  - avoid over-refactoring
  - refactoring guidelines
  - prevent over-engineering
  - refactoring best practices
