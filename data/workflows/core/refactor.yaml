description: Execute systematic code refactoring process.
triggers:
  - refactor code
  - improve code
  - execute refactoring
  - optimize code
  - clean up code
steps:
  - 'Function extraction: Refactor one function at a time using systematic methodology.'
  - 'Regression tests: Execute test suite immediately after each refactoring step to ensure no functional changes.'
  - 'Quality validation: Run linting and type checking tools to ensure standards compliance.'
  - 'Update documentation: Revise function documentation and comments to reflect refactored structure.'
  - 'Commit incremental changes: Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commit format.'
  - 'Verify functionality preservation: Ensure all existing functionality remains intact after refactoring.'
