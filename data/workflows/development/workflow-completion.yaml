description: Ensures all workflow sessions are properly completed or broken out before
  ending development sessions.
name: workflow-completion
project_types: []
steps:
  - "Identify all active workflow sessions: Used 'list_workflow_sessions' to check
    for active sessions."
  - "Ensure: Session health monitored: Used 'monitor_sessions' to check for alerts
    about dormant or forgotten workflows"
  - 'Alerts addressed: Any session alerts (dormant, stale, forgotten completion): resolved'
  - "Ensure: Workflows advanced or completed: Active workflows either advanced with
    'advance_workflow' or completed with 'break_workflow'"
  - "Ensure: Stale sessions cleaned: Used 'cleanup_stale_sessions' to remove old inactive
    sessions"
  - "Ensure: No orphaned sessions: Final check with 'list_workflow_sessions' shows
    no unintended active sessions"
  - 'Ensure: Workflow lifecycle respected: All workflow state transitions properly managed
    (start → advance/break → complete)'
  - "Ensure: Session monitoring clean: 'monitor_sessions' shows no remaining alerts
    or issues"
triggers:
  - workflow completion validation
  - session workflow check
  - validate workflow status
  - check incomplete workflows
