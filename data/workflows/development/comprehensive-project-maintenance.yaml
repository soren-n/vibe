steps:
  - 'Ensure: Security audit shows no vulnerabilities in current dependencies'
  - 'All unused dependencies: identified and removed'

  - 'Package lock files: updated and consistent with package manifests'
  - 'Meta-packages and wrapper dependencies: evaluated and removed if redundant'
  - 'Ensure: CI/CD workflows contain no obsolete workarounds or deprecated installation
    steps'
  - 'Ensure: Build processes complete successfully with optimized dependencies'
  - 'Ensure: All test suites pass with the current dependency set'
  - 'Core application functionality: preserved after cleanup'
  - 'Version control ignore patterns: updated to exclude temporary files'
  - 'Build artifacts and temporary files: cleaned from the repository'
  - 'Installation instructions: accurate and tested'
  - 'Ensure: Documentation reflects current project state and requirements'
  - 'Dependency update strategy: documented and automated where possible'
  - 'Ensure: Performance metrics show improvement in build time, installation time,
    or bundle size'
  - 'Security monitoring: configured for ongoing dependency health'
  - 'Project structure: organized and free of legacy artifacts'
triggers:
