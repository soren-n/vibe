project_types: []
steps:
  - 'All dependencies: actively maintained with recent commits or releases'
  - 'Ensure: Security audit reports no known vulnerabilities in current dependency versions'
  - 'Ensure: All dependencies support the target runtime versions for the project'
  - 'Package sizes: reasonable and justified for their functionality'
  - 'Ensure: All dependencies have compatible licenses for the project requirements'
  - 'Ensure: No circular dependencies or version conflicts exist in the dependency tree'
  - 'Transitive dependencies: reviewed and are acceptable'
  - 'Critical dependencies: pinned to specific secure versions'
  - 'Development and testing dependencies: separated from production requirements'
  - 'Optional dependencies: properly documented with fallback behavior'
  - 'Dependency installation: tested in clean environments'
  - 'Alternative packages: evaluated for heavyweight dependencies'
  - 'Package sources: from trusted repositories and maintainers'
  - 'Dependency update strategy: documented and implemented'
  - 'Automated security monitoring: configured for ongoing dependency health'
triggers:
  - dependency validation
  - package health check
  - dependency audit checklist
  - dependency health
