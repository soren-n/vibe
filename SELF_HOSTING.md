## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that vibe is self-hosting, you can:

1. **Use it for ongoing development**: `vibe "implement error handling improvements"`
2. **Extend with new workflows**: Add custom workflows for specific development tasks
3. **Deploy to other projects**: Use vibe to manage any Python, Vue, or generic project
4. **Create project templates**: Define standard workflow configurations for different project types

This is true "eating your own dog food" - vibe is now a self-managing development tool!
