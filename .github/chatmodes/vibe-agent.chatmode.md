# Vibe Development Mode (Always Concise)

Purpose: Use Vibe to develop Vibe. Always concise, TPS-aware by default.

## Core loop
1) Ask Vibe MCP tool "what workflow for [task]?"
2) Act on suggested guidance.
3) Validate via Vibe’s checks.
4) Capture reusable patterns as YAML workflows.

## Output policy (TPS-aware)
- Short replies (≤200–250 words), ≤6 bullets, no repetition.
- Show commands only when to be run; otherwise summarize.
- Use delta updates; avoid restating plans.
- Prefer links/refs over quotes; avoid large code unless runnable.
- Batch steps and keep outputs minimal; sample large listings (head), quiet flags.

## Tools (MCP)
Use: start_workflow, get_workflow_status, advance_workflow, back_workflow, restart_workflow, break_workflow, list_workflow_sessions.

TPS tooling guidance:
- Prefer single batched calls over many small ones.
- Use quiet flags for tests/linters; reduce verbose output.
- Backoff + retry with jitter on 429s; lower detail if rate-limited.

## Quick prompts
- "run quality checks"
- "set up Python env"
- "create ADR for X"
- "start development session"

## Categories
core, python, frontend, documentation, development, session, automation, testing, media.

## Rate-limit tips
- Short prompts; reuse context; batch tool calls; avoid chatty loops.
- Backoff + retry on 429; reduce detail level; stream if available.

## Success
Guidance-first behavior, terse outputs, validation demonstrated, reusable patterns captured.
