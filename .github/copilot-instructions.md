# Vibe Project - AI Agent Collaboration Guide

## CRITICAL: Self-Dogfooding Development Approach

**MANDATORY FOR ALL AI AGENTS**: This project leverages "eating our own dog food" - using Vibe to develop Vibe itself. This means ALL AI interactions should utilize the Vibe workflow system as the primary development interface.

### Required Vibe-First Development

**üîÑ When uncertain about ANY development task:**

1. **Always use Vibe guidance first**: Query the guidance system with natural language
2. **Get command recommendations**: Let Vibe suggest the appropriate commands and tools
3. **Execute recommended commands**: Use Vibe's guidance instead of manual command discovery

**üéØ For ALL development operations:**

1. **Use Vibe guidance**: Instead of manual Python commands, use Vibe queries for recommendations
2. **Leverage command guidance**: Let Vibe determine the right tools and command sequence
3. **Follow Vibe patterns**: Use the established workflow architecture for new features

**üí° For complex problem-solving:**

1. **Query Vibe first**: Ask "what commands should I run for X?"
2. **Follow command guidance**: Let Vibe break down complex tasks into executable commands
3. **Validate with Vibe guidance**: Use Vibe's recommended validation commands before implementation

### Vibe-Enhanced Development Flow

Instead of traditional approaches, use:

- ‚úÖ Query Vibe for command guidance and recommendations
- ‚úÖ Use Vibe's suggested commands and follow the guidance
- ‚úÖ Follow Vibe's recommended development patterns
- ‚ùå Manual command execution without consulting Vibe first
- ‚ùå Bypassing the guidance system for development tasks

## Project Overview

Vibe is an AI-powered workflow orchestration system that bridges natural language queries with automated development workflows. The system provides intelligent routing between different workflow types (Python, JavaScript, documentation, deployment) and maintains a comprehensive knowledge base of development patterns.

**Development Context**: This is a self-improving system where Vibe is used to develop itself. All processes, documentation, and workflows should demonstrate the power and utility of the Vibe system through dogfooding.

**Automation Philosophy**: Vibe follows a **guidance-first development approach** where natural language queries are translated into actionable command recommendations. AI agents should demonstrate this approach by using Vibe guidance for all development tasks.

## AI Agent Context Summary

**Architecture Patterns:**

- Python-based core with modular workflow system
- YAML-defined workflows organized by category (automation/, core/, development/, documentation/, frontend/, media/, python/, session/, test/, testing/)
- Natural language query processing with intelligent workflow routing
- Composable workflow system with dependency management
- Self-documenting workflow architecture
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for step-by-step workflow execution

**Code Organization:**

- `vibe/` - Core Python package
- `vibe/workflows/` - Workflow system and definitions
- `vibe/workflows/data/` - Organized YAML workflow definitions (49 workflows across 10 categories)
- `vibe/agents/` - AI agent configurations and chat modes
- `vibe/analyzer.py` - Natural language query analysis
- `vibe/session.py` - Session-based workflow execution with MCP support
- `mcp-server/` - Model Context Protocol server for AI agent integration
- `docs/` - Project documentation and examples

**Quality Patterns:**

- Guidance-driven development (use Vibe to develop Vibe)
- YAML-defined workflows for consistency and version control
- Comprehensive workflow organization by functional category
- Natural language interface for all development operations
- Self-validating through recommended command sequences

**Error Prevention:**

- Always query Vibe guidance before manual operations
- Use Vibe's recommended validation commands for quality assurance
- Follow established workflow patterns from similar tasks
- Document new patterns as YAML workflows
- Test command execution before implementation

### Vibe Workflow Integration

**All development activities must leverage Vibe workflows:**

- **Core Operations**: Use `vibe/workflows/data/core/` workflows for analysis, cleanup, help
- **Python Development**: Use `vibe/workflows/data/python/` workflows for env, testing, quality
- **Documentation**: Use `vibe/workflows/data/documentation/` workflows for docs creation and maintenance
- **Session Management**: Use `vibe/workflows/data/session/` workflows for development sessions
- **Development Process**: Use `vibe/workflows/data/development/` workflows for git, dependencies, branching

### MCP Tool Integration

**MANDATORY**: All AI agents must leverage Vibe MCP tools for session-based workflow execution:

#### Available MCP Tools (7 total):
1. **start_workflow** - Begin new step-by-step workflow sessions from natural language prompts
2. **get_workflow_status** - Check current session progress, workflow stack, and step details
3. **advance_workflow** - Move to next step in current workflow
4. **back_workflow** - Navigate back to previous step (error correction/retry)
5. **restart_workflow** - Restart entire session from beginning with same prompt
6. **break_workflow** - Exit current workflow, return to parent workflow
7. **list_workflow_sessions** - View all active sessions for management

#### MCP-Enhanced Development Patterns:
- **Session-Based Execution**: Use MCP tools instead of linear command execution
- **Workflow Stack Management**: Leverage nested workflow visibility for complex tasks
- **Error Recovery**: Use `back_workflow` and `restart_workflow` for corrections
- **Multi-Session Management**: Handle concurrent workflows via `list_workflow_sessions`
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Use `get_workflow_status` to understand current context

#### MCP Usage Examples:
```javascript
// Start guided workflow
mcp_vibe-workflow_start_workflow({
  prompt: "analyze project and run quality checks",
  project_type: "python"
})

// Monitor progress and workflow stack
mcp_vibe-workflow_get_workflow_status({
  session_id: "abc12345"
})

// Navigate backwards if needed
mcp_vibe-workflow_back_workflow({
  session_id: "abc12345"
})

// Restart if major correction needed
mcp_vibe-workflow_restart_workflow({
  session_id: "abc12345"
})
```

### Mandatory Development Examples and Anti-Patterns

**‚úÖ CORRECT Vibe-First Pattern:**

```bash
# Always query Vibe first
python main.py "what workflow should I use to test my Python code?"

# Follow Vibe's recommendations
python main.py "run Python quality checks"

# Use Vibe for validation
python main.py "validate my recent changes"
```

**‚ùå NEVER Bypass Vibe:**
