    Represents a complete workflow with triggers, guidance steps, and metadata.

    A workflow consists of:
    - name: Unique identifier for the workflow
    - description: Human-readable description of what the workflow does
    - triggers: List of patterns that should activate this workflow
    - steps: List of guidance text/suggestions (may contain commands, but not limited to commands)
    - dependencies: Optional list of required tools/packages
    - project_types: Optional list of project types this applies to
    - conditions: Optional list of conditions that must be met

    Note: Steps are textual guidance, not executable commands. They provide suggestions,
    reminders, and directions that humans can follow. Commands may be included within
    the guidance text when appropriate.
