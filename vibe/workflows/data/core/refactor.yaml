description: "♻️ Code refactoring and quality improvements"
triggers:
  - "refactor"
  - "improve code"
  - "code quality"
  - "optimize"
  - "clean up"
steps:
  - "♻️ **Identify large files** that might need breaking up: `find . -name '*.py' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.ts' | xargs wc -l | sort -n | tail -5`"
  - "🔍 **Look for code duplication** - similar functions or logic that could be extracted into reusable components"
  - "📏 **Review function complexity** - functions with too many parameters or complex logic that could be simplified"
  - "📚 **Update documentation and comments** - ensure they accurately reflect current code behavior"
  - "🧪 **Ensure tests exist** for code you're about to refactor - this provides safety during changes"
  - "💡 **Make small, incremental changes** - refactor in small steps and test frequently"
  - "🔄 **Consider design patterns** that might improve code organization and maintainability"
