description: "Code refactoring and quality improvements"
triggers:
  - "refactor"
  - "improve code"
  - "code quality"
  - "optimize"
  - "clean up"
steps:
  - "Identify large files that might need breaking up: Find code files (*.py, *.js, *.ts) and check their line counts to identify largest files"
  - "Look for code duplication - similar functions or logic that could be extracted into reusable components"
  - "Review function complexity - functions with too many parameters or complex logic that could be simplified"
  - "Update documentation and comments - ensure they accurately reflect current code behavior"
  - "Ensure tests exist for code you're about to refactor - this provides safety during changes"
  - "Make small, incremental changes - refactor in small steps and test frequently"
  - "Consider design patterns that might improve code organization and maintainability"
