triggers:

  - "config status"
steps:
  - "🔍 **Check for Vibe configuration file**: Look for `.vibe.yaml` in your project root with `find . -maxdepth 1 -name '.vibe.yaml'`"
  - "✅ **If found**: Your project has custom Vibe configuration - review the settings to understand your workflow setup"
  - "❌ **If missing**: Vibe will use default workflows - this is normal for most projects"
  - "🔧 **Optional**: Create a `.vibe.yaml` file if you want to customize workflow behavior for this project"
  - "📋 **Environment validation**: Ensure required tools (Python, uv, etc.) are available for your project type"
