steps:
  - "🔍 **Run linting checks**: `uv run ruff check .` to identify code style and quality issues"
  - "🛠️ **Auto-fix linting issues**: `uv run ruff check --fix .` to automatically resolve fixable issues"
  - "📏 **Format code**: `uv run ruff format .` to ensure consistent code formatting (modern alternative to black)"
  - "🔤 **Type checking**: `uv run mypy .` to validate type annotations and catch type-related issues"
  - "🧪 **Run tests after quality fixes**: `uv run pytest` to ensure code quality doesn't break functionality"
  - "📋 **Check imports**: Look for unused imports, missing imports, and import organization"
  - "📚 **Docstring quality**: Ensure all public functions have proper docstrings following standards"
  - "🔒 **Security scan**: `uv run bandit -r .` for security vulnerability detection (install with `uv add --dev bandit` if needed, optional)"
  - "📦 **Dependency audit**: Check for known security vulnerabilities with `pip-audit` (install with `uv add --dev pip-audit` if needed) or use GitHub security advisories"
  - "✅ **Final validation**: Verify all quality checks pass before considering work complete"
  - "💡 **Consider pre-commit hooks**: Set up automated quality checks with `pre-commit install` for future commits"
