steps:
  - "Quick Decision Tree: Bug fix → `patch/vX.Y.Z` (merge immediately), New feature → `minor/vX.Y.0` (merge when tested), Breaking change → `major/vX.0.0` (postpone & collect)"
  - "Analyze Change Impact: Check if change breaks existing code (major), adds functionality (minor), or fixes bugs (patch)"
  - "Patch Changes: Use for bug fixes, security patches, documentation fixes, performance optimizations, test fixes - merge immediately when ready"
  - "Minor Changes: Use for new features, API endpoints, configuration options, enhanced functionality - merge when feature complete and tested"
  - "Major Changes: Use for API breaking changes, removed features, changed behavior, architecture refactors - postpone and collect related changes"
  - "Create Branch: Run `git checkout main` → `git pull origin main` → `git checkout -b [type]/v[version]`"
  - "Commit with Conventional Format: Use `fix:`, `feat:`, or `feat!:` prefix with descriptive message"
  - "Merge Timing: Immediate for patch/minor (safe, no breaking changes), postponed for major (coordinate and bundle breaking changes)"
  - "Check Current Status: Run `git branch --show-current` and check recent tags to see current state and version"
  - "Version Planning: Check latest tag and plan next version - patch increments Z, minor increments Y (resets Z), major increments X (resets Y,Z)"
  - "Merge Readiness: For patch/minor verify tests pass, code reviewed, docs updated, no breaking changes"
  - "Major Coordination: For major changes, plan migration guide, coordinate with stakeholders, bundle related breaking changes"
