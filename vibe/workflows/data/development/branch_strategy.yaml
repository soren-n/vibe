steps:
  - "**Quick Decision Tree**: Bug fix → `patch/vX.Y.Z` (merge immediately), New feature → `minor/vX.Y.0` (merge when tested), Breaking change → `major/vX.0.0` (postpone & collect)"
  - "🧭 **Analyze Change Impact**: Check if change breaks existing code (major), adds functionality (minor), or fixes bugs (patch)"
  - "🐛 **Patch Changes**: Use for bug fixes, security patches, documentation fixes, performance optimizations, test fixes - merge immediately when ready"
  - "✨ **Minor Changes**: Use for new features, API endpoints, configuration options, enhanced functionality - merge when feature complete and tested"
  - "💥 **Major Changes**: Use for API breaking changes, removed features, changed behavior, architecture refactors - postpone and collect related changes"
  - "🌿 **Create Branch**: Run `git checkout main` → `git pull origin main` → `git checkout -b [type]/v[version]`"
  - "📝 **Commit with Conventional Format**: Use `fix:`, `feat:`, or `feat!:` prefix with descriptive message"
  - "⏰ **Merge Timing**: Immediate for patch/minor (safe, no breaking changes), postponed for major (coordinate and bundle breaking changes)"
  - "📊 **Check Current Status**: Run `git branch --show-current` and `git tag -l | tail -3` to see current state and version"
  - "🎯 **Version Planning**: Check latest tag and plan next version - patch increments Z, minor increments Y (resets Z), major increments X (resets Y,Z)"
  - "✅ **Merge Readiness**: For patch/minor verify tests pass, code reviewed, docs updated, no breaking changes"
  - "⏳ **Major Coordination**: For major changes, plan migration guide, coordinate with stakeholders, bundle related breaking changes"
