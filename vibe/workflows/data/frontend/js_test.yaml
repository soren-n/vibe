  - "Common test runners: Jest, Vitest, Mocha - configure according to your project needs"
  - "Review test results and address any failing tests before proceeding (prefer `--silent` or concise reporters)"
  - "Consider test coverage: Add `--coverage` flag to see how much of your code is tested"
  - "For continuous testing: Use `npm test -- --watch` to run tests automatically on file changes"
