triggers:
  - "complete session"
  - "finish session"
  - "wrap up"
  - "session cleanup"
steps:

  - "Commit your changes if you have work that should be saved: `git add .` and `git commit -m \"your message\"`"
  - "Look for temporary files: Search for debug files (debug-*.html), temp files (*.tmp), backups (*.bak)"
  - "Consider what you accomplished this session and what remains to be done"
  - "Use \"session retrospective\" for a detailed analysis of what you learned and next steps"
  - "Use \"cleanup\" for a comprehensive project hygiene check if needed"
  - "End with a clean working tree - either commit changes or stash them for later"
  - "Stay concise: capture outcomes in â‰¤6 bullets; avoid verbose logs and paste links instead of large output."
