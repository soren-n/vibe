dependencies:
  - "docs directory structure"
  - "ADR template"
conditions:
  - "When significant architectural decisions are made"
  - "When design patterns are established"
  - "When technology choices need documentation"
  - "When reviewing past decisions"
steps:
  - " **Check ADR Structure**: Verify `docs/adr/` directory exists and contains `adr-template.md` - create if missing with `mkdir -p docs/adr`"
  - "📊 **Review Existing ADRs**: List current ADRs with `find docs/adr -name '*.md' | sort` to understand decision history and determine next number"
  - "📝 **Create New ADR**: Copy template to `docs/adr/adr-XXX-decision-title.md` using sequential numbering"
  - "🎯 **Document Context**: Clearly explain the problem, constraints, and circumstances that motivate this architectural decision"
  - "⚖️ **Record Decision**: State exactly what change will be made and why this approach was chosen over alternatives"
  - "🔄 **Explain Rationale**: Document alternatives considered, trade-offs evaluated, and reasoning behind the final choice"
  - "📊 **Detail Consequences**: Honestly assess what becomes easier/harder, risks involved, and long-term implications"
  - "🔧 **Implementation Plan**: Provide actionable next steps and references for how the decision will be executed"
  - "🏷️ **Set Status**: Mark as Proposed (under consideration), Accepted (implemented), Deprecated (outdated), or Superseded (replaced)"
  - "🔗 **Link and Reference**: Connect ADR to related code commits, issues, documentation, and cross-reference related ADRs"
  - "✅ **Quality Review**: Ensure title is clear, language is jargon-free, stakeholders are identified, and all sections are complete"
  - "💾 **Commit with Code**: Include ADR in the same commit as related code changes to maintain decision-implementation traceability"
