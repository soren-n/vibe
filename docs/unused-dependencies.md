## Summary

A comprehensive unused dependency detection and quality gate system has been implemented using Knip, the industry-standard tool for detecting unused dependencies, exports, and files in TypeScript/JavaScript projects.

### Tools Added

- Knip configured specifically for the project structure with knip.json
- Integration with existing quality processes and npm scripts

### NPM Scripts Added

```bash
npm run deps:check        # Quick dependency check
npm run deps:check:json   # Detailed JSON report
npm run deps:fix          # Auto-fix issues (use carefully)
npm run quality           # Now includes dependency checking
```

### Vibe Workflows Created

1. "Unused Dependencies Detection" - Focused dependency analysis workflow
2. "Dependency Quality Gate" - Comprehensive quality validation
3. "Quality Validation" - Streamlined quality workflow using npm scripts

### Validation Checklists

- unused-dependencies-validation.yaml - Specific to dependency cleanup
- dependency-quality-gate-validation.yaml - Comprehensive quality gate
- quality-validation.yaml - Quick quality validation checklist

### Current Results

The tool identified optimizations in the project:

- Unused dependencies: @clack/prompts, picocolors, zod
- Unused files: Some test utilities and registry files
- Unused exports: Various utility functions
- Missing dependencies: @eslint/js

### Integration Benefits

- Vibe-native: Fully integrated with the workflow orchestration system
- Quality gates: Dependency checking is part of the quality process
- Guided workflows: Use `npm run dev guide "check my dependencies"` for guidance
- Automated: Can be run in CI/CD pipelines
- Configurable: Exceptions and ignore patterns in knip.json

### Next Steps

1. Review findings: `npm run deps:check` to see current issues
2. Validate results: Use the validation checklists to verify findings
3. Clean up safely: `npm run deps:fix` after reviewing (or manual cleanup)
4. Integrate in CI: Add dependency checking to CI/CD pipeline
5. Team adoption: Use Vibe workflows for guided dependency management

The implementation follows the project philosophy of making everything functional and integrated with the Vibe system, providing both automated tooling and human-guided validation processes.
