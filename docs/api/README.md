# API Reference

This directory contains comprehensive API documentation for all Vibe components. These documents provide sufficient detail to recreate the entire implementation.

## Core Components

- [PromptAnalyzer](prompt-analyzer.md) - Analyzes prompts and matches workflows/checklists
- [WorkflowOrchestrator](workflow-orchestrator.md) - Plans and orchestrates workflow execution
- [SessionManager](session-manager.md) - Manages step-by-step execution state
- [Configuration](configuration.md) - Handles project configuration and detection

## Data Models

- [Core Data Models](models.md) - Core data structures for workflows, checklists, and sessions
- [Session Models](session-models.md) - Session state and workflow frame structures

## Guidance System

- [Workflow Registry](workflow-registry.md) - YAML workflow loading and caching with hot reloading
- [Project Detection](project-detection.md) - Intelligent project type detection algorithms

## Quality Assurance

- [Lint System](lint.md) - Code quality, naming conventions, and professional language checking

## CLI Interface

- [Command Interface](cli.md) - Command-line interface structure and smart routing
- [Session Monitoring](session-monitoring.md) - AI agent workflow completion tracking and intervention

## Implementation Completeness

Each API document includes:

- Complete class definitions with all methods and properties
- Detailed implementation algorithms and logic
- Error handling patterns and strategies
- Integration examples and usage patterns
- Data structure relationships and serialization
- Performance considerations and optimizations

These documents contain sufficient detail to recreate the entire `/vibe` implementation without additional context or explanations.
