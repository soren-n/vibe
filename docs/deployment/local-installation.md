# Local Installation and Safety

## Deployment Model

Vibe is a **user-installable MCP tool**, not a deployed web service. This fundamentally changes our approach to:

### What We Focus On

- **User Safety**: File system operations are secure and sandboxed appropriately
- **Installation Quality**: Clean, reliable installation process via npm
- **Local Execution**: Robust operation in diverse local environments
- **Distribution**: Package integrity and dependency management

### What We Don't Need

- **Server Operations**: No load balancing, scaling, or uptime concerns
- **Web Security**: No CORS, authentication, or web attack vectors
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: No distributed tracing or centralized logging
- **Production Deployment**: No CI/CD pipelines to production servers

## User Safety Considerations

### File System Security

- Validate all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Restrict operations to user's workspace/project directories
- Handle permissions gracefully with clear error messages
- Never modify system files or directories outside project scope

### Dependency Safety

- Minimal dependency tree to reduce attack surface
- Pin dependencies to specific versions
- Regular security audits of npm dependencies
- Clear documentation of file system access patterns

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation when permissions are insufficient
- Clear error messages for user-fixable issues
- Safe cleanup of temporary files and sessions
- No silent failures that could corrupt user data

## Installation Quality Standards

### Package Distribution

- Clean npm package with only necessary files
- Proper engine requirements (Node.js version)
- Clear installation instructions
- Offline-capable after initial install

### Local Environment Support

- Works across macOS, Linux, Windows
- Handles different shell environments
- Respects user's existing tool configurations
- Minimal system requirements

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Safe local file operations
- ✅ Clean npm install/uninstall
- ✅ Works in air-gapped environments
- ✅ User data never corrupted
- ✅ Clear error messages for user issues
- ❌ No server uptime metrics
- ❌ No distributed system concerns
- ❌ No web security vulnerabilities
