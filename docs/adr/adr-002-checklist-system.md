# ADR-002: Checklist System Integration

**Date**: 2025-08-11
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

The workflow system provided step-by-step guidance for accomplishing tasks, but lacked a structured way to verify that work was completed properly. Users needed a way to validate their work quality, ensure compliance with standards, and check that all required steps were completed after following workflows.

While workflows guide users through processes, there was no systematic way to verify completion quality or ensure nothing was missed. This gap could lead to incomplete implementations, missed quality checks, or inconsistent adherence to project standards.

## Decision

Implement a checklist system alongside the existing workflow system. Checklists provide structured validation items to verify work quality and completion after workflows are executed.

### Key Features:
- **Separate Concept**: Checklists are distinct from workflows but integrated into the same analysis system
- **YAML-Based**: Use same YAML infrastructure as workflows for consistency
- **Project-Type Aware**: Checklists can be specific to project types (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- **Trigger-Based**: Activated by natural language patterns similar to workflows
- **Visual Distinction**: Use âœ… emoji prefix for checklist items vs ðŸ”„ for workflows

## Rationale

### Why Checklists vs More Workflows
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Workflows = "how to do it", Checklists = "did you do it right?"
- **Different Use Cases**: Workflows guide implementation, checklists verify completion
- **Mental Model**: Users understand the distinction between guidance and validation

### Why Integrate with Existing System
- **Unified Experience**: Single command (`vibe guide`) suggests both workflows and checklists
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reuse YAML loading, trigger matching, and analysis systems
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same file organization and discovery mechanisms

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Separate Tool**: Create standalone checklist tool
   - Rejected: Would fragment user experience and require separate learning
2. **Workflow Extensions**: Add validation steps to existing workflows
   - Rejected: Would blur conceptual boundaries and make workflows longer
3. **Database Storage**: Store checklists in database vs YAML files
   - Rejected: Would break consistency with workflow system

## Consequences

### What Becomes Easier
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured validation of work completion
- **Completeness Checking**: Ensure nothing is missed after implementation
- **Standards Compliance**: Consistent verification against project standards
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Checklists capture institutional knowledge about "done criteria"
- **Review Process**: Clear validation points for code reviews and releases

### What Becomes More Difficult
- **Initial Setup**: Need to create and maintain checklist definitions
- **Cognitive Load**: Users need to understand both workflows and checklists
- **File Management**: More YAML files to organize and maintain

### Risks Introduced
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Checklists need updates when processes change
- **Analysis Complexity**: More complex prompt analysis with two types of suggestions
- **User Confusion**: Risk of users not understanding when to use which

### Risk Mitigation
- **Clear Documentation**: Explain workflow vs checklist distinction clearly
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use same file organization and naming conventions
- **Visual Cues**: Clear emoji-based distinction in output
- **Project-Type Filtering**: Only show relevant checklists for current project

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ…
1. âœ… Create `Checklist` dataclass in `models.py`
2. âœ… Extend `WorkflowLoader` to load checklists from `checklists/` directory
3. âœ… Update JSON schema validation to support `items` field
4. âœ… Add global functions for checklist access

### Phase 2: Analysis Integration âœ…
5. âœ… Extend `PromptAnalyzer` to detect checklist triggers
6. âœ… Update analysis display to show both workflows and checklists
7. âœ… Implement project-type filtering for checklists
8. âœ… Use `checklist:` prefix in analysis results

### Phase 3: Orchestration Integration âœ…
9. âœ… Update `WorkflowOrchestrator` to handle checklist items
10. âœ… Modify execution plan generation to include checklists
11. âœ… Update guidance formatting with âœ… emoji for checklists
12. âœ… Ensure checklists appear after workflows in execution order

### Phase 4: Content Creation âœ…
13. âœ… Create directory structure: `checklists/{core,python,development}/`
14. âœ… Implement example checklists:
    - Quality Check (general)
    - Python Release Readiness (Python-specific)
    - Feature Development (development process)
    - Bug Fix Verification (development process)
15. âœ… Add comprehensive documentation and README

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation âœ…
16. âœ… Create comprehensive test suite for checklist functionality
17. âœ… Verify integration with existing workflow tests
18. âœ… Test project-type filtering and trigger matching
19. âœ… Validate end-to-end user experience

## Notes

### File Structure
```
vibe/workflows/data/
â”œâ”€â”€ checklists/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quality_check.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ python/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ release_readiness.yaml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ development/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ feature_development.yaml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ bug_fix.yaml
â””â”€â”€ [existing workflow directories...]
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# General quality validation
vibe guide "quality check"

# Python release preparation
vibe guide "release ready" --project-type python

# Feature development validation
vibe guide "feature checklist"

# Bug fix verification
vibe guide "bug fix verification"
```

### Success Metrics
- âœ… Checklists load successfully alongside workflows
- âœ… Prompt analysis correctly identifies checklist triggers
- âœ… Project-type filtering works for Python-specific checklists
- âœ… Visual distinction clear in output (âœ… vs ðŸ”„)
- âœ… All existing tests continue to pass
- âœ… New functionality comprehensively tested

### Future Enhancements
- **Interactive Mode**: Allow checking off completed items
- **Progress Tracking**: Remember checklist completion state
- **Checklist Templates**: Generate checklists from workflow completion
- **Integration Hooks**: Link checklist completion to CI/CD gates
