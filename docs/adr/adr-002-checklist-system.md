# ADR-002: Checklist System Integration

**Date**: 2025-08-11
**Status**: Accepted
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context

Workflow system provided task guidance but lacked structured work validation. Users needed systematic verification of completion quality, standards compliance, and thoroughness after executing workflows.

**Gap**: No systematic way to verify implementation quality or ensure comprehensive completion.

## Decision

Implement checklist system alongside workflows for structured validation:

- **Separate Concept**: Workflows guide implementation, checklists verify completion
- **YAML-Based**: Consistent infrastructure with workflows
- **Project-Type Aware**: Context-specific validation items
- **Trigger-Based**: Natural language activation patterns
- **Visual Distinction**: âœ… checklist items vs ðŸ”„ workflow steps

## Rationale

**Conceptual Clarity**: Distinct "how to implement" vs "verification complete" mental models
**Unified Experience**: Single analysis system for both guidance and validation
**Shared Infrastructure**: Leverages existing YAML loading and trigger matching

**Alternatives Rejected**:

- Separate tool: Fragments user experience
- Workflow extensions: Blurs conceptual boundaries
- Database storage: Breaks consistency with workflow system

## Implementation

**Components Delivered**:

- `Checklist` dataclass with validation items
- Extended `WorkflowLoader` for checklist loading
- Updated `PromptAnalyzer` for dual workflow/checklist detection
- Project-type filtering and visual distinction (âœ… vs ðŸ”„)
- Schema validation supporting checklist structure

**Usage Examples**:

```bash
vibe guide "feature checklist"     # Feature development validation
vibe guide "bug fix verification"  # Bug fix completion checks
```

## Results

**Success Metrics**:

- âœ… Checklists integrate with workflow system
- âœ… Project-type filtering operational
- âœ… Clear visual distinction in output
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage maintained

**Benefits Realized**: Structured quality assurance, completion verification, standards compliance validation
